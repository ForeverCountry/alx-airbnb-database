# Airbnb Database Sample Data Script

## Introduction
This repository contains the SQL script (`seed.sql`) to populate the Airbnb database with sample data. The sample data reflects real-world usage scenarios and provides a foundation for testing and development.

## Sample Data Overview
The script includes sample data for all six entities:
1. **User**: Three users (guest, host, admin) with diverse roles.
2. **Property**: Two properties listed by a host.
3. **Booking**: Two bookings made by a guest.
4. **Payment**: A payment associated with one confirmed booking.
5. **Review**: Feedback left by the guest for the properties.
6. **Message**: Messages exchanged between the guest and host.

### Example Usage Scenarios:
- Alice (guest) books properties hosted by Bob and leaves reviews for her stays.
- Payments are recorded for confirmed bookings.
- Messages demonstrate communication between users.
